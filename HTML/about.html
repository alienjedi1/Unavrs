      <h2>What is AR/VR?</h2>
      <p>Imagine a world where you could fly. A world where you control everything that happens. A world where you are a duck surviving in a mineshaft. Well, you don't need to imagine much longer due to the wonderful technology of Virtual and Augmented Reality. VR/AR is cutting edge technology that adds virtual elements to everyday life, or can even create an entirely new virtual world for you to experience.</p>
      <h2> How does it work? </h2>
      <p>Virtual and Augmented Reality is a very simple system by which you can obtain amazing educational and exciting experiences. Virtual reality technology consists of special goggles containing an LCD screen that images can easily be projected on. Your eyes are fully enclosed in the lens, so you only can see what is on the screen, turning everything you see into a brand new reality. Using hand-held controlers with high-tech sensors, the system picks up all of your movements and processes them, making your arms the controllers. The goggles also detect what direction they are pointed, so when you turn your head, it moves the screen too! Augmented reality shows everything that is truly around you, but also adds virtual elements to create an amazing effect. </p>

      <p> VR/AR systems have a high chance of being used in education, and we, UNAVRS AR/VR company, plan to be pioneers to kickstart VR/AR education. Virtual reality technology could take students to places they could never actually travel. When learning about insects, they could become the insect, learn about what it needs to do, its adaptations, and have an experience they will never forget. When learning about the function of blood, they could become red blood cells, and do their everyday jobs. We can provide so many amazing teaching experiences that no one will forget. It's a wonder it isn't used everywhere already!</p>
